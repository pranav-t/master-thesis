Evaluation & Results 	(15 pages)
---------------------

	Experiment Setup
		Deployment
		Configuration
	Workload
	Performance Metrics
	Control Parameters
	Execution(summarize general steps)

	Experiments(1-n)
	describe setup and expectated behaviour
	plot observations and interpretations
	
	

	Point out that when VMS is running on top of HBase the Baseic LogCleaner class is overridden. So the WAL size would grow as long as updates are not processed by VMS regardless of weather they are flushed to disk or not(which is the default behaviour).
