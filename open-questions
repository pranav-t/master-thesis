0. 	can the VMS be called a SQL-on-Hadoop framework?
	can it be compared to impala/hive/phoenix?
	where in the hadoop ecosystem does it fit?

1. 	we are benchmarking the VMS - not HBase RIGHT?
	why not tpc-ds? newer? more complex? can't find spec!?
	the distributed nature of the database system must be transparent to the benchmark.... we might as well be running it on a mysql/oracle database

2. 	would the VMS support all the 22 TPC-H queries and all the data load statements including creation of constratints(which are optional)?
	are we running a subset of the TPC-H?
	(if we are using the benchmark for finding the best configurations then a subset of the benchmarking test might suffice. If we are using it to compare it against other systems then we need to make sure the
	syste is capable of supporting all the operations requried for the benchmark)

3.  tpc-h requires ACID. But HBase doesn't support ACID. Is it the VMS's job to ensure ACID or do we do away with the ACID properties?

4. 	common understanding of a TPC-H run - DISCUSS
	is it possible to do all this in the VMS?

	two kinds of tests  --> vary cluster configuration/tuning parameters for a given scale factor: helps us find an optimal config for a particualr scale factor/database size
						--> vary scale factor for a fixed cluster configuration: helps us to compare it to other databases having similar configuariton and operating on same database size


joins
aggregate functions
where clause with fuzzy comparizon like clause / range comparison/ date comparison
group by / conditional group by (with having clause)

	-------------------

1. startvms.sh vs startmaster.sh ??

	startvms: 		de.webdataplatform.test.VMS start
	startmaster:	de.webdataplatform.test.VMS startmaster

		SystemConfig.load(log);
		NetworkConfig.load(log);

		startVMSystem						startMaster
			startRegionServers();				de.webdataplatform.master.TestMaster master1 currenthostIp 5555(from config)
			startViewManagers();				initialize and then run MasterController
												where are the RS and VMs started?


2. startvmsclient.sh 

	de.webdataplatform.client.VMSClient

		client = new VMSClient(log, "client1", NetworkConfig.VMS_CLIENT, 5555);
		client.initialize(args);	

	why does status show 0 RS and VMs?


3. what is going on in RunEvaluation?

	init
		create base tables
		startmaster
		add queries

	runEvaluation
		reload queries
		fill base tables
		startvms
		wait for vms to finish
		stopvms
		throughput detailed/summary/rs detailed/rs summary
