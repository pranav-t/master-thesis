\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we developed a scalable view maintenance system (\VMS),
fully integrated with a distributed \KVS. We demonstrated the
efficient, incremental, and deferred materialization of selection,
index, aggregation, and join views based on \VMS\ and realizes as part
of \HB. Our approach is capable of consistently maintain multiple
views that may depend on each other.  In the spirit today's \KVSs, our
view maintenance architecture is designed to be incrementally
scalable, thus, accommodating the addition of view managers as
maintenance load increases. In our approach, a stream of base table
updates is propagated to view tables by a bank of view managers
operating in parallel. To establish view table consistency, we resort
to the application of a number of known techniques that are combined
in novel ways to materialize views consistently at large scale. We
also address fault tolerance and recovery to react to failing view
managers. Our experimental evaluation quantified the benefits and cost
of the approach and showed that it scales linearly in view update load
and number of view managers running. There are many avenues for future
work, such as exploring optimizations for the maintenance of multiple,
overlapping view expressions and exploring automatic means for
reacting to view maintenance load variations.
