\title{A view maintenance concept for key-value stores}

%\titlenote{A full version of this paper is available as\textit{Author's Guide to Preparing ACM SIG Proceedings Using \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and BibTeX} at \texttt{www.acm.org/eaddress.htm}}}

% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{8} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
Executing SQL-like queries on distributed data sets in key-value stores(KV-stores) 
is a well known problem. While providing high availability, high write throughputs
and mechanisms for fault tolerance, KV-stores sacrifice data semantics and powerful 
query languages. To reintroduce the SQL-like query capabilities, we propose a 
concept for materializing views in KV-stores. The different view types form  -- when 
combined with each other -- the basis to build up a higher-level SQL-language. Further,
the materialized views can be created and maintained efficiently to deliver fresh
data for frequently accessed computations.

% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{vldb_sample}  % vldb_sample.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references

\subsection{References}
Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references).

%APPENDIX is optional.
% ****************** APPENDIX **************************************
% Example of an appendix; typically would start on a new page
%pagebreak

\begin{appendix}
You can use an appendix for optional proofs or details of your evaluation which are not absolutely necessary to the core understanding of your paper. 

\section{Final Thoughts on Good Layout}
Please use readable font sizes in the figures and graphs. Avoid tempering with the correct border values, and the spacing (and format) of both text and captions of the PVLDB format (e.g. captions are bold).

At the end, please check for an overall pleasant layout, e.g. by ensuring a readable and logical positioning of any floating figures and tables. Please also check for any line overflows, which are only allowed in extraordinary circumstances (such as wide formulas or URLs where a line wrap would be counterintuitive).

Use the \texttt{balance} package together with a \texttt{\char'134 balance} command at the end of your document to ensure that the last page has balanced (i.e. same length) columns.
