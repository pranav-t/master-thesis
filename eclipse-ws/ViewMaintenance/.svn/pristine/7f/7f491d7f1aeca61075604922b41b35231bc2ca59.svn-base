\title{Dynamic Scalable View Maintenance in KV-stores}

% possible, but not really needed or used for PVLDB:
%\subtitle{[Extended Abstract]
%\titlenote{A full version of this paper is available as\textit{Author's Guide to Preparing ACM SIG Proceedings Using \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and BibTeX} at \texttt{www.acm.org/eaddress.htm}}}

% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.
% author on the opening page (as the 'third row') but we ask,
% for aesthetic reasons that you place these 'additional authors'
% in the \additional authors block, viz.
\additionalauthors{Additional authors: John Smith (The Th{\o}rv\"{a}ld Group, {\texttt{jsmith@affiliation.org}}), Julius P.~Kumquat
(The \raggedright{Kumquat} Consortium, {\small \texttt{jpkumquat@consortium.net}}), and Ahmet Sacan (Drexel University, {\small \texttt{ahmetdevel@gmail.com}})}
\date{30 July 1999}
% Just remember to make sure that the TOTAL number of authors
% is the number that will appear on the first page PLUS the
% number that will appear in the \additionalauthors section.


\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Distributed \textit{key-value stores} have become the solution of
choice for many data-intensive applications. However, their limited
query language support imposes challenges for applications that
require sophisticated query capabilities.  To address this problem, in
this paper, we develop the \textit{View Maintenance System} (\VMS) to
incrementally maintain selection, projection, aggregation, and join
views on behalf of applications.  We design \VMS\ given a generic
\KVS\ model based on a small number of features available in many
popular store architectures.  \VMS\ supports the maintenance of
hundreds of views in parallel, while simultaneously providing
guarantees for view consistency, even under node crash scenarios.  To
evaluate our concepts, we deliver a full-fledged implementation of
\VMS\ through Apache's \HB\ and conduct an extensive experimental
study. Exploiting parallel maintenance, \VMS\ achieve 
throughputs up to 60k view updates per second (120k table updates).

% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{vldb_sample}  % vldb_sample.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
%\subsection{References}
%Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
%then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references).

%APPENDIX is optional.
% ****************** APPENDIX **************************************
% Example of an appendix; typically would start on a new page
%pagebreak

%\begin{appendix}
%You can use an appendix for optional proofs or details of your evaluation which are not absolutely necessary to the core understanding of your paper. 
%
%\section{Final Thoughts on Good Layout}
%Please use readable font sizes in the figures and graphs. Avoid tempering with the correct border values, and the spacing (and format) of both text and captions of the PVLDB format (e.g. captions are bold).
%
%At the end, please check for an overall pleasant layout, e.g. by ensuring a readable and logical positioning of any floating figures and tables. Please also check for any line overflows, which are only allowed in extraordinary circumstances (such as wide formulas or URLs where a line wrap would be counterintuitive).
%
%Use the \texttt{balance} package together with a \texttt{\char'134 balance} command at the end of your document to ensure that the last page has balanced (i.e. same length) columns.
